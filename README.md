**üìù Overview**

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is designed with a unique, minimalist, hand-drawn sketch aesthetic to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, and Full-Stack Developer.

The entire website is built as a clean, single-page application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it is lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.
